GrandHack
=========

Eyely was an application developed for the Healthcare GrandHack Hackaton at the MIT Media Lab in March of 2014. The goal of this program is to create a simple and configurable interface for nurses to use with paralized patients. Often, patients are paralyzed and don't have the capacity to communicate with their caregiver verbally or physically yet still maintain agility with their eyes. However, professional eye-tracking software and hardware costs thousands of dollars, so we wanted to develop a cheap and simple solution.

We used a simple computer webcam and a simple web-based UI to allow for a user to select one of four configurable choices displayed on the screen. We used a python backend (running OpenCV) and a JS/CSS frontend to communicate with the user.

Since this was developed at a hackathon, it is obviously a prototype but could lay the groundwork for some innovative and meaninfull software.
